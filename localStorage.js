    backstory: `David Martinez grew up in Santo Domingo (Heywood) with his mother, Gloria. Despite struggling financially, she enrolled him in the prestigious Arasaka Academy, hoping to give him a chance at a better life. After her death in a drive-by incident, David was left alone, grieving, angry, and unable to afford school. In desperation — and driven by his desire to prove himself — David installed a stolen Sandevistan military cyberware, a risky and highly illegal act. This caught the attention of Lucy and the Edgerunner crew, who pulled him into the world of merc work, gigs, and high-risk cyber-enhancements. David's natural talent with the Sandevistan pushed him into the center of Night City's violent power struggles.`,
